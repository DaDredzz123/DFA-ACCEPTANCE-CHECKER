# DFA-ACCEPTANCE-CHECKER
The DFA String Acceptance Checker is a Java program designed to simulate a Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA) that recognizes binary strings ending with the substring “01.” This program demonstrates how automata theory concepts can be applied through programming by simulating state transitions based on user input.
